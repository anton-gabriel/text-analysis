Programming involves tasks such as: analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms in a chosen programming language (commonly referred to as coding). The source code of a program is written in one or more languages that are intelligible to programmers, rather than machine code, which is directly executed by the central processing unit. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate the performance of a task (which can be as complex as an operating system) on a computer, often for solving a given problem. The process of programming thus often requires expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms, and formal logic.\\nTasks accompanying and related to programming include: testing, debugging, source code maintenance, implementation of build systems, and management of derived artifacts, such as the machine code of computer programs. These might be considered part of the programming process, but often the term software development is used for this larger process with the term programming, implementation, or coding reserved for the actual writing of code. Software engineering combines engineering techniques with software development practices. Reverse engineering is the opposite process. A hacker is any skilled computer expert that uses their technical knowledge to overcome a problem, but it can also mean a security hacker in common language.\",\n",
       "       \"A programming language is a formal language, which comprises a set of instructions that produce various kinds of output. Programming languages are used in computer programming to implement algorithms.\\nMost programming languages consist of instructions for computers. There are programmable machines that use a set of specific instructions, rather than general programming languages. Early ones preceded the invention of the digital computer, the first probably being the automatic flute player described in the 9th century by the brothers Musa in Baghdad, during the Islamic Golden Age. Since the early 1800s, programs have been used to direct the behavior of machines such as Jacquard looms, music boxes and player pianos. The programs for these machines (such as a player piano's scrolls) did not produce different behavior in response to different inputs or conditions.\\nThousands of different programming languages have been created, and more are being created every year. Many programming languages are written in an imperative form (i.e., as a sequence of operations to perform) while other languages use the declarative form (i.e. the desired result is specified, not how to achieve it).\\nThe description of a programming language is usually split into the two components of syntax (form) and semantics (meaning). Some languages are defined by a specification document (for example, the C programming language is specified by an ISO Standard) while other languages (such as Perl) have a dominant implementation that is treated as a reference. Some languages have both, with the basic language defined by a standard and extensions taken from the dominant implementation being common.\",\n",

POSIX, Windows API and ASPI are examples of different forms of APIs. Documentation for the API usually is provided to facilitate usage and implementation.\\nMore recently, the term has been often used to refer to a specific kind of interface between a client and a server, which has been described as a “contract” between both - such that if the client makes a request in a specific format, it will always get a response in a specific format or initiate a defined action. This is a specialized form of API though, more precisely defined as a WEB API.',\n",
       "       \"In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. It is a declarative programming paradigm in that programming is done with expressions or declarations instead of statements. In functional code, the output value of a function depends only on its arguments, so calling a function with the same value for an argument always produces the same result. This is in contrast to imperative programming where, in addition to a function's arguments, global program state can affect a function's resulting value. Eliminating side effects, that is, changes in state that do not depend on the function inputs, can make understanding a program easier, which is one of the key motivations for the development of functional programming.\\nFunctional programming has its origins in lambda calculus, a formal system developed in the 1930s to investigate computability, the Entscheidungsproblem, function definition, function application, and recursion. Many functional programming languages can be viewed as elaborations on the lambda calculus. Another well-known declarative programming paradigm, logic programming, is based on relations.In contrast, imperative programming changes state with statements in the source code, the simplest example being assignment. Imperative programming has subroutines, but these are not mathematical functions. They can have side effects that may change a program's state, allowing for functions without return values. Because of this, they lack referential transparency, that is, the same language expression can result in different values at different times depending on the state of the executing program.Functional programming languages have largely been emphasized in academia rather than industry settings. However, programming languages that support functional programming have been used in industry, including Common Lisp, Scheme, Clojure, Wolfram Language, Racket, Erlang, OCaml, Haskell, and F#. JavaScript, one of the world's most widely distributed languages, has the properties of a dynamically typed functional language, in addition to imperative and object-oriented paradigms. Functional programming is also key to some languages that have found success in specific domains, like R in statistics, J, K and Q in financial analysis, and XQuery/XSLT for XML. Domain-specific declarative languages like SQL and Lex/Yacc use some elements of functional programming, especially in not supporting mutable values.Programming in a functional style can be accomplished in languages that are not specifically designed for functional programming, such as with Perl, PHP, C++11, and Kotlin.  A hybrid case is that of Scala – it is frequently written in a functional style, but the presence of side effects and mutable state place it in a grey area between imperative and functional languages.\",\n",

       "       \"Programming paradigms are a way to classify programming languages based on their features. Languages can be classified into multiple paradigms.\\nSome paradigms are concerned mainly with implications for the execution model of the language, such as allowing side effects, or whether the sequence of operations is defined by the execution model.  Other paradigms are concerned mainly with the way that code is organized, such as grouping a code into units along with the state that is modified by the code.  Yet others are concerned mainly with the style of syntax and grammar.\\nCommon programming paradigms include:\\nimperative in which the programmer instructs the machine how to change its state,\\nprocedural which groups instructions into procedures,\\nobject-oriented which groups instructions together with the part of the state they operate on,\\ndeclarative in which the programmer merely declares properties of the desired result, but not how to compute it\\nfunctional in which the desired result is declared as the value of a series of function applications,\\nlogic in which the desired result is declared as the answer to a question about a system of facts and rules,\\nmathematical in which the desired result is declared as the solution of an optimization problemSymbolic techniques such as reflection, which allow the program to refer to itself, might also be considered as a programming paradigm. However, this is compatible with the major paradigms and thus is not a real paradigm in its own right.\\nFor example, languages that fall into the imperative paradigm have two main features: they state the order in which operations occur, with constructs that explicitly control that order, and they allow side effects, in which state can be modified at one point in time, within one unit of code, and then later read at a different point in time inside a different unit of code.  The communication between the units of code is not explicit.  Meanwhile, in object-oriented programming, code is organized into objects that contain state that is only modified by the code that is part of the object.  Most object-oriented languages are also imperative languages.  In contrast, languages that fit the declarative paradigm do not state the order in which to execute operations.  Instead, they supply a number of operations that are available in the system, along with the conditions under which each is allowed to execute.  The implementation of the language's execution model tracks which operations are free to execute and chooses the order on its own. More at  Comparison of multi-paradigm programming languages.\",\n",
       "       'Logic programming is a type of programming paradigm which is largely based on formal logic. Any program written in a logic programming language is a set of sentences in logical form, expressing facts and rules about some problem domain.  Major logic programming language families include Prolog, answer set programming (ASP) and Datalog. In all of these languages, rules are written in the form of clauses:\\n\\nH :- B1, …, Bn.and are read declaratively as logical implications:\\n\\nH if B1 and … and Bn.H is called the head of the rule and B1, ..., Bn is called the body. Facts are rules that have no body, and are written in the simplified form:\\n\\nH.In the simplest case in which H, B1, ..., Bn are all atomic formulae, these clauses are called definite clauses or Horn clauses. However, there exist many extensions of this simple case, the most important one being the case in which conditions in the body of a clause can also be negations of atomic formulae. Logic programming languages that include this extension have the knowledge representation capabilities of a non-monotonic logic.\\nIn ASP and Datalog, logic programs have only a declarative reading, and their execution is performed by means of a proof procedure or model generator whose behaviour is not meant to be under the control of the programmer. However, in the Prolog family of languages, logic programs also have a procedural interpretation as goal-reduction procedures:\\n\\nto solve H, solve B1, and ... and solve Bn.Consider, for example, the following clause:\\n\\nfallible(X) :- human(X).based on an example used by Terry Winograd to illustrate the programming language Planner. As a clause in a logic program, it can be used both as a procedure to test whether X is fallible by testing whether X is human, and as a procedure to find  an X that is fallible by finding an X that is human. Even facts have a procedural interpretation. For example, the clause:\\n\\nhuman(socrates).can be used both as a procedure to show that socrates is human, and as a procedure to find  an X that is human by \"assigning\" socrates to X.\\nThe declarative reading of logic programs can be used by a programmer to verify their correctness. Moreover, logic-based program transformation techniques can also be used to transform logic programs into logically equivalent programs that are more efficient. In the Prolog family of logic programming languages, the programmer can also use the known problem-solving behaviour of the execution mechanism to improve the efficiency of programs.',\n",

Fogel used finite-state machines as predictors and evolved them.\\nCurrently evolutionary programming is a wide evolutionary computing dialect with no fixed structure or (representation), in contrast with some of the other dialects. It is becoming harder to distinguish from evolutionary strategies.\\nIts main variation operator is mutation; members of the population are viewed as part of a specific species rather than members of the same species therefore each parent generates an offspring, using a (μ + μ) survivor selection.',\n",
       "       'Ajax (also AJAX ; short for \"Asynchronous JavaScript + XML\") is a set of web development techniques using many web technologies on the client side to create asynchronous web applications. With Ajax, web applications can send and retrieve data from a server asynchronously (in the background) without interfering with the display and behavior of the existing page. By decoupling the data interchange layer from the presentation layer, Ajax allows web pages and, by extension, web applications, to change content dynamically without the need to reload the entire page. In practice, modern implementations commonly utilize JSON instead of XML.\\nAjax is not a single technology, but rather a group of technologies. HTML and CSS can be used in combination to mark up and style information. The webpage can then be modified by JavaScript to dynamically display—and allow the user to interact with—the new information. The built-in XMLHttpRequest object, or since 2017 the new \"fetch()\" function within JavaScript, is commonly used to execute Ajax on webpages allowing websites to load content onto the screen without refreshing the page. Ajax is not a new technology, or different language, just existing technologies used in new ways.',\n",

Early programming languages were highly specialized, relying on mathematical notation and similarly obscure syntax. Throughout the 20th century, research in compiler theory lead to the creation of high-level programming languages, which use a more accessible syntax to communicate instructions. \\nThe first high-level programming language was Plankalkül, created by Konrad Zuse between 1942 and 1945. The first high-level language to have an associated compiler was created by Corrado Böhm in 1951, for his PhD thesis. The first commercially available language was FORTRAN (FORmula TRANslation); developed in 1956 (first manual appeared in 1956, but first developed in 1954) by a team led by John Backus at IBM.',\n",
       "       'Computer software, or simply software, is a collection of data or computer instructions that tell the computer how to work. This is in contrast to physical hardware, from which the system is built and actually performs the work. In computer science and software engineering, computer software is all information processed by computer systems, programs and data. Computer software includes computer programs, libraries and related non-executable data, such as online documentation or digital media. Computer hardware and software require each other and neither can be realistically used on its own.\\nAt the lowest programming level, executable code consists of machine language instructions supported by an individual processor—typically a central processing unit (CPU) or a graphics processing unit (GPU). A machine language consists of groups of binary values signifying processor instructions that change the state of the computer from its preceding state. For example, an instruction may change the value stored in a particular storage location in the computer—an effect that is not directly observable to the user. An instruction may also invoke one of many input or output operations, for example displaying some text on a computer screen; causing state changes which should be visible to the user. The processor executes the instructions in the order they are provided, unless it is instructed to \"jump\" to a different instruction, or is interrupted by the operating system. As of 2015, most personal computers, smartphone devices and servers have processors with multiple execution units or multiple processors performing computation together, and computing has become a much more concurrent activity than in the past.\\nThe majority of software is written in high-level programming languages. They are easier and more efficient for programmers because they are closer to natural languages than machine languages. High-level languages are translated into machine language using a compiler or an interpreter or a combination of the two. Software may also be written in a low-level assembly language, which has strong correspondence to the computer\\'s machine language instructions and is translated into machine language using an assembler.',\n",
       "       'Structured programming is a programming paradigm aimed at improving the clarity, quality, and development time of a computer program by making extensive use of the structured control flow constructs of selection (if/then/else) and repetition (while and for), block structures, and subroutines.\\nIt emerged in the late 1950s with the appearance of the ALGOL 58 and ALGOL 60 programming languages, with the latter including support for block structures. Contributing factors to its popularity and widespread acceptance, at first in academia and later among practitioners, include the discovery of what is now known as the structured program theorem in 1966, and the publication of the influential \"Go To Statement Considered Harmful\" open letter in 1968 by Dutch computer scientist Edsger W.

       "       'In computing, reactive programming is a declarative programming paradigm concerned with data streams and the propagation of change. With this paradigm it is possible to express static (e.g., arrays) or dynamic (e.g., event emitters) data streams with ease, and also communicate that an inferred dependency within the associated execution model exists, which facilitates the automatic propagation of the changed data flow.For example, in an imperative programming setting, \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        a\\n        :=\\n        b\\n        +\\n        c\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle a:=b+c}\\n   would mean that \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        a\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle a}\\n   is being assigned the result of \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        b\\n        +\\n        c\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle b+c}\\n   in the instant the expression is evaluated, and later, the values of \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        b\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle b}\\n   and \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        c\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle c}\\n   can be changed with no effect on the value of \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        a\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle a}\\n  . On the other hand, in reactive programming, the value of \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        a\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle a}\\n   is automatically updated whenever the values of \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        b\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle b}\\n   or \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        c\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle c}\\n   change, without the program having to re-execute the statement \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        a\\n        :=\\n        b\\n        +\\n        c\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle a:=b+c}\\n   to determine the presently assigned value of \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        a\\n        .\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle a.}\\n  Another example is a hardware description language such as Verilog, where reactive programming enables changes to be modeled as they propagate through circuits.Reactive programming has been proposed as a way to simplify the creation of interactive user interfaces and near-real-time system animation.For example, in a model–view–controller (MVC) architecture, reactive programming can facilitate changes in an underlying model that are reflected automatically in an associated view.\\n\\n',\n",

This is in contrast with imperative programming, which implements algorithms in explicit steps.\\nDeclarative programming often considers programs as theories of a formal logic, and computations as deductions in that logic space.

       "\"Computer programming is the process of designing and building an executable computer program for accomplishing a specific computing task. Programming involves tasks such as: analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms in a chosen programming language (commonly referred to as coding). The source code of a program is written in one or more languages that are intelligible to programmers, rather than machine code, which is directly executed by the central processing unit. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate the performance of a task (which can be as complex as an operating system) on a computer, often for solving a given problem. The process of programming thus often requires expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms, and formal logic.\\nTasks accompanying and related to programming include: testing, debugging, source code maintenance, implementation of build systems, and management of derived artifacts, such as the machine code of computer programs. These might be considered part of the programming process, but often the term software development is used for this larger process with the term programming, implementation, or coding reserved for the actual writing of code. Software engineering combines engineering techniques with software development practices. Reverse engineering is the opposite process. A hacker is any skilled computer expert that uses their technical knowledge to overcome a problem, but it can also mean a security hacker in common language.\""
